                    <p>I started out by doing robotics in elementary school and later again in high school, and combined with my passion for games decided to continue learning about programming and computers in college.
                        My main fields of interest are in machine learning, digital accessiblity, and software engineering.</p>
                    <p>Outside of computers, I usually spend my time reading books or playing video games. I also like studying languages both in terms of acquisition and linguistics.</p>

                            <p>I worked as both a member and later as a programming lead in an FTC team at my high school, where cooperation between programming and engineering teams designed a robot that accomplished competition goals.
                                My work involved using Java to direct the robot under both automated routines and human-driven input using the provided SDK.</p>

                            <p>As part of the team, I also created and maintained a front-facing website for our outreach using HTML and Javascript through the Bootstrap framework. I also prototyped a static site generator-based version using Gatsby.js.</p>

                            <p>I participated in the 2024 Crimson Game Jam with other teammates, prototyping a top-down procedural roguelike in Unity 2D. Although the game remains unfinished, it relies on a central mechanic of being able to periodically freeze projectiles and enemies to dodge.</p>

                            <p>For a competition as a part of FBLA, a career student organization, I worked with others to design and code a shmup game. I utilized a C-like framework to create enemy bullet patterns in game, specifying mathematical transformations with functions.</p>
