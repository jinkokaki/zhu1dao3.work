                    <p>I started out by doing robotics in elementary school and later again in high school, and combined with my passion for games decided to continue learning about programming and computers in college.
                        My main fields of interest are in machine learning, digital accessiblity, and software engineering.</p>
                    <p>Outside of computers, I usually spend my time reading books or playing video games. I also like studying languages both in terms of acquisition and linguistics.</p>

                            <p>I worked as both a member and later as a programming lead in an FTC team at my high school, where cooperation between programming and engineering teams designed a robot that accomplished competition goals.
                                My work involved using Java to direct the robot under both automated routines and human-driven input using the provided SDK.</p>
